== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I define my own substitutions? =

Add this code to your theme's `functions.php` file:
`
function my_cyr_to_lat_table($ctl_table) {
   $ctl_table['ะช'] = 'U';
   $ctl_table['ั'] = 'u';
   return $ctl_table;
}
add_filter('ctl_table', 'my_cyr_to_lat_table');
`

== How can I convert a large number of posts/terms using wp-cli? ==

Use the following command in console:

`
wp cyr2lat regenerate [--post_type=<post_type>] [--post_status=<post_status>]
`

Where
  `-post_type` is list of post types,
  `-post_status` is list of post statuses.
